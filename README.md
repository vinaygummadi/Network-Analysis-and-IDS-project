# Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## Overview
This project implements a Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using various machine learning algorithms. It analyzes network traffic data and classifies it as normal or malicious. The system supports multiple classifiers and visualizes traffic patterns for better insights.

## Features
- Supports multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.).
- Handles data preprocessing, scaling, and dimensionality reduction using PCA.
- Visualizes traffic patterns and classifier decision boundaries.
- Supports parallel execution of multiple classifiers.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Libraries (install using `requirements.txt`):
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - scikit-learn

## Setup and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vinaygummadi/Network-Analysis-and-IDS-project
   cd Network-Analysis-and-IDS-project
